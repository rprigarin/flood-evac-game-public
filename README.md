<h1>Flood Evacuation Game (<i>Prototype, version 1.0</i>)</h1>
<h2>About the game</h2>

This game is written for the University of Exeter as part of my individual project. To learn more about the game, please read the GameGuide.pdf

<h2>How to run the game</h2>

1. Unzip flood-evac-game-prototype-v1.zip
2. Launch Flood Evacuation Game.exe

<h2>Additional notes</h2>

The game is compiled for Windows only. So far it has been tested on Windows 10 and 11 64-bit computers, as well as university computers, and it seemed to run fine.

The game sends anonymous replay data to a remote replay server. Your replay becomes visible on the leaderboard if you reach top 10. Data usage is talked about in the ToS screen when you first launch the game.

Windows Defender might yell at the game executable since it cannot identify its publisher. At the moment I do not have a workaround for this. If this makes you uncomfortable, feel free to not play the game.

The player registration system for quite primitive. Make sure you input a unique alphanumeric name, more than 2 characters and less than 32. After registration, you get a pin code for your account that you can hold on to.

A Google Forms survey is available for you to leave feedback on the game. To do this, please visit <a href="https://flood-evac-game-uoe.com/">flood-evac-game-uoe.com</a> and find a link below.
