<h1>Flood Evacuation Game (<i>Prototype, version 1.3</i>)</h1>

This game is written for the University of Exeter as part of my individual project. To learn more about the game, please read the GameGuide.pdf

<h2>How to run the game</h2>

1. Download the game from GitHub by clicking "Code" -> "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip flood-evac-game-prototype-v1-3.zip
3. Launch Flood Evacuation Game.exe

<h2>Notes about the game</h2>

The game is compiled for Windows only. So far it has been tested on Windows 10 and 11 64-bit computers, as well as university computers, and it seemed to run fine.

Upon first booting the game, you are greeted with the Terms of Service screen regarding data usage. Upon successfully completing the game, replay data is transferred to a remote server. The replay becomes available in the leaderboard.

The player registration system is quite primitive. Make sure you input a unique alphanumeric name, more than 2 characters and less than 32. After registration, you get a pin code for your account that you can hold on to.

A Google Forms survey is available for you to leave feedback on the game. To do this, please visit <a href="https://flood-evac-game-uoe.com/survey">flood-evac-game-uoe.com/survey</a>.
